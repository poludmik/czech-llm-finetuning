Czech MorfFlex2+PDT-C Models
============================

To use this model, you need MorphoDiTa: Morphological Dictionary and Tagger, an
open-source tool for morphological analysis of natural language texts. Please
visit the MorphoDiTa website http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita for more
information.

MorphoDiTa version 1.9 or later.

Apart from MorfFlex CZ dictionary, a prefix guesser and statistical guesser are
implemented and can be optionally used when performing morphological analysis.

MorfFlex CZ 2.0 Morphological System
------------------------------------

The MorfFlex CZ 2.0 uses a so-called PDT-C tag set, which is an evolution of the
original PDT tag set devised by Jan Hajič (Hajič 2004
(http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)). The tags are positional with 15
positions corresponding to part of speech, detailed part of speech, gender,
number, case, etc. (e.g. NNFS1-----A----). Different meanings of same lemmas are
distinguished and additional comments can be provided for every lemma meaning.
The lemma itself without the comments and meaning specification is called a raw
lemma. The following examples illustrate this:

- Japonsko_;G (raw lemma: Japonsko)
- se_^(zvr._zájmeno/částice) (raw lemma: se)
- tvořit_:T (raw lemma: tvořit)

The complete reference can be found in the Manual for Morphological Annotation,
Revision for the Prague Dependency Treebank - Consolidated 2020 release
(https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/techrep/tr64.pdf).


PDT-C 1.0 Train/Dev/Test Split
------------------------------

The PDT-C corpus consists of four datasets, but some of them do not have an
official train/dev/test split. We therefore used the following split:

- PDT dataset is already split into train, dev (dtest), and test (etest).
- PCEDT dataset is a translated version of the Wall Street Journal, so we used
  the usual split into train (sections 0-18), dev (sections 19-21), and test
  (sections 22-24).
- PDTSC and FAUST datasets have no split, so we split it into dev (documents
  with identifiers ending with 6), test (documents with identifiers ending with
  7), and train (all the remaining documents).


Model Variants
--------------

Apart from the primary model, which predicts all the 15 tag positions and
processed texts with diacritics, we also provide several variants:

- pos_only: Instead of all 15 tag positions, the model predicts only the first
  2, which contain the coarse and detailed POS, plus the full lemma, while being
  circa 15 times faster than the primary model.

- no_dia, no_dia-pos_only: The forms (during morphological analysis,
  generation, and tagging) have the diacritical marks stripped; however, the
  lemmas do include them. Useful for processing texts without diacritics.
